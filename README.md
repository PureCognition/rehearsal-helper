# rehearsal-helper
This is a small program I wrote to help my daughter practice her lines for her musical theater class.  It read the lines and stage directions that cue her speaking parts.  She then reads her parts and presses ENTER to continue.

# To Run:
You may need to run:
pip install pyttsx3
That's the dependency for the TTS library I used.

Then, simply run:
python main.py
